							<h3>Can I afford insurance?</h3>
							<p>If you're wondering about the cost of an insurance policy it's worth thinking about what would happen if you didn't have it. Who would provide for your family if you couldn't work? Would the mortgage continue to be paid? Would the cost of schooling for your children be covered? There are many levels of insurance you can choose and there's always the option of starting with what you can afford now and increasing your protection when you feel you can. Think of it like protecting your whole income with just a small portion of it. Talking to one of our professional insurance consultants will give you a clearer idea of what your needs might be. </p>
